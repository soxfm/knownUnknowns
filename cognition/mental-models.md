# Mental Models 

> A mental model is simply a representation of how something works. We cannot keep all of the dtails of the world in our brains, so we use models to simplify the complex into understandable and organizable chunks. 

## Learning to Think Better

The quality of our thinking is proportional to the models in our head and their usefulness in the situation at hand. The more models you have -- the bigger your toolbox -- the more likely you are to have the right models to see reality. It turns out that when it ocmes to improving your ability to make decisions variety matters. 

Most of us, however, are specialists. Instead of a latticework of mental models, we have a few from our discipline. Each specialist sees something idffernt. By default, a typical Engineer will think in systems. A psychologist will think in terms of incentives. A biologist will think in term of evolution. By putting these discpliners togethers in our head, we can walk around a proplem in a three dimensional way. If we're only looking at a problem one way, we've got a blind spot. 

In a famous speech in the 1990s, Charlie Munger summed up the approach to practical wisdom through understanding mental models by saying: “Well, the first rule is that you can’t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ’em back. If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form. You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience both vicarious and direct on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.”
