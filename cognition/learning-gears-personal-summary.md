### The Three Gears:

1. Explorer
2. Connector
3. Miner

### Explorer

- This is a stage which the main **Problem to Solve** is: **You don't know what yoy don't know**
- " High speed gear". He whose concern and primary objetive is to 'cover as much ground as possible';
 -- in other words, the objective is one which is not only postponed into the future but at the same time its scattered. 
- There's much to explore, however much of the knowledge still remains upon the upper layers of cognition; depth and specializaiton are yet to be specified. 
- Considered as a 'Starting point': many different areas are being experimented  with although, there's still an underlying common denominator which is missing("still trying to uncover that which resonates with your innner self and your own interests")
- Given these key points; the most frontworthy takeaway is: the individual's lack of commitment.(he dips his toes into several different areas, however isn't really specializing or commiting to a single endeavour.)


### Connector

- Main Problem to Solve is that **"You Know Things which other Do Not"**
- The **Main Concern** here is: communicating your ideas in order to both educate others all the while making things easier to understand. Regarded as "the best way to learn the fundamentals"; -- given that, the simple of art of conveying an idea or a piece of knowledge into something which is easier for others to understand; creates within you not only a solid foundation of the principles invovled but also, by translating and communicating ideas into your own words creates within you a certain byproduct of personal insight. 
- Such insight is extremely useful for self-knowledge because it also poses an opportunity for perceiving things in a different light. (ie. Asking questions you hadn't thought of before and/or creating links in between concepts which, previously, weren't thought to be related.)
- Moderate public commitment : The individual's own work does posses some sort of personal underlying theme however he's also digesting/working/"juggling" multiple themes at the same time.

### Miner

"Reserve the Miner gear for when you've struck gold. Something that resonates with people, that you are also abnormally fascinated by. When you strike gold, you'll know. Stop and plant your flag."(SW-YX)

- The subject matter is of such importance and its order of magnitude goes to such great lenghts that its impact has the potential to become considerably fascinating/tremendous.
- "The creative exhaust you make is very specialized - you do research and build community and infrastructure. What you do is meant to last. Before you, the thing was very hard, or impossible. After you, the thing becomes much easier."
