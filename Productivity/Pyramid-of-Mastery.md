## The Pyramid of Mastery
4. Frameworks
3. Tools
2. Rules
1. Elements

1. Elements: is the first and mos basic layer that describes the building blocks of the domain you're looking to master. This layer serves as the foundation of every bit of knowledge you are going to learn; every skill you're going to master, and every insight you'll uncover.
	Elements are the basic, most fundamental concepts that define a domain. eg.) (ANALOGY): 'they're like lego pieces; if you don't possess many different types of parts you wont be able to construct something complex '.
2. The rules: they define the constants which govern a particular domain. These include how the Elements interact with one another; which elements can be combined, and how to couple them as well as the general Rules within the craft; -- the *workflow* the interaction with the actors and variable introduced.
3. Tools: this layer defines the isntruments you have at your disposal.
	Tools can be straightforward, reasonably complex, or quite sophisticated. Whatever the degree of complexity; you should learn the ins and outs of the tools you are going to use. Otherwise. it will take longer to perform a given task; -- the same goes for overall quality of task itself.
4. Frameworks: Frameworks are a system of subset of Elements, Rules, and Tools that combined allow for a more seamless achievement of a set of goals.
	Frameworks are nothing but layers of abstraction that hide the underlying fundamentals behind a friendly facade that's easy to use. They're developed by people who have a specific goal (or set of goals) in mind. Thus, creators of Frameworks wrap the Elements, Rules and, Tools in a simple manner consisting of sequential steps that yield a particular(desired) result.â€¨> Thus, they're most signifcant advantage is that they can speed up the work and reduce the complexity of a task; -- you don't have to understand all the details how Elements interact through which Rules as long as you follow the Framework's steps and rules.
