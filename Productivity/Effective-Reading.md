# Guide to effective Reading

## **"What you can’t explain to others, you don’t understand yourself."** (Richard Feynman)

Information processing: from working memory into understanding.

**Mental Models**: are mental, simplified depictions of how something works. Mental models order complexity, attribute relevancy or irrelevancy weight-like proportions of importance and, eventually shape one's, individual thought process and reasoning. -- they help us: filter, organize and, understand. 

"The more limited one's repertoire of personal constructs, the greater the anxiety and the fewer the degrees of freedom one has in anticipating and acting upon events in your daily life. This helps explain why your sister can't seem to move beyond her divorce, ins pite of all your attempts to give her new things to do. She treats everyon in terms of a simple construct 'trustworthy vs. will leave me in a flash like Sam did.' and, in so doing she reduces her degrees of freedom and retreats from re-engaging with life and moving ahead."
(Me, Myself, and Us. Brian R. Little, 2016)

> **Learning** = upgrading your mental models
“integrative complexity”: the skill to integrate multiple sources and perspectives into a bigger, more coherent picture.
The quality of our thinking is proportional to the models in our head and their usefulness in the situation at hand.

> **For something to become a part of your assembly of mental models you need to process it. That happens through engagement and repetition.**

### Active Reading
- **WHY?** -> 'Why is the material at hand being read'; -- what's the reason behind, driving the necessary focus to engage with the subject at hand.
- Determine the central concept, hypothesis, thesis, conclusion, objective underlying the subject/material at hand. 
- Take Notes

### QEC Method
Studying requires notetaking. However, merely transcribing the information won't cut it; in order to actually process and understand the material, one should actively engage with it. 
> __The Method itself, is quite simple:__ **"Reduce the infromation presented to you into questions paired with conclusions. Between the two, list the evidence that justifies the connections.** (Questions and conclusions become a sort of wrapper revolving around the raw facts -- thus, one might even speculate that they become "containerized ideas" (self-perpetuating, individual concepts.) )

1. **QEC** notes start with the question posed by the information you're consuming. 
The idea is to reconstruct the argument within a few lines.
2. As the section continues, record the relevant facts which underly the support for the given argument. 
3. While recording the evidence; -- a though process beings to unravel: "What is the conclusion that such data is leaning towards?"

### "What you can’t explain to others, you don’t understand yourself." (R. Feynman)
#### Feynman Techinque
1. Choose a concept
2. Teach it to a child or someone without prior knowledge in the field;
3. Identify gaps(areas where you're own grasp or understanding are fuzzy)
4. Improve & Repeat.
