# Guide To Staying Productive
(Original Author: Jon Schlinkert.)
### Weights and Measures
- how to define success: why are we doing what we're doing? knowing when "good" is good enough.
- how to measure results: you cant manage what you cant measure, and you cant improve if you dont have a baseline from which to gauge progress.
- how to move on: when its time to move on to something else.
#### Defining Producitivity
The first thing about being productive is understanding what "productive" really means. Staying "busy" doesn't mean you're staying productive. The word "product" is at the root of the word productive, which is a synonym for "result". That's what we're after, results.
#### Defining Success
If only it stopped with "results" we would all work fewer hours, and worry a lot less. But achieving results means much more than plowing ahead at all cost. If we're not achieving the "desired results", then we're just wasting time. Thus it's important for us to always try to measure our productivity against how we'll we're achieving the "desired results" in whatever task, project, role, mission or area of responsibility is pertinent at the time.
#### Defining a beginning, middle and end
If red flags are going off, and you're not even sure what the "desired results" should be for whatever you're working on, have no fear, we're going to cover this and more in the following sections. For now, let's take a step back and start at the beginning.
#### why are we doing it?
Why we're doing what we're doing.
### Motivational lenses
to stay productive, we need to stay motivated. To stay motivated; we nneed to have incentives. In order to maintain motivation over time; we need to have *purpose*.
Incentive is much easier to define and understand than purpose. For example, if we were only interested in motivate others to achieve short-term goals, we might offer monetary incentives, awards, or other tangible achievements. How one obtains this sense of "meaning" is very personal. Self-defined goals and aspirations that transcend any kind of short-term incentives or external stimulus can be very powerful motivators.
As a starting point, establishing meaningful frames-of-reference will give you the ability to more easily sift through the goals, objectives and tasks that need to be accomplished on a day-to-day basis. We will never have time to do everything we want or need to do. These "lenses" will help us focus on what really matters, when it really matters, so that we can ignore everything else with peace of mind.
### Timescales
- lifetime: You should never feel worry or stress when you think about what you want to accomplish in your lifetime. Reflecting upon this timespan should inspire hopes and dreams. Use these long-term goals to drive you forward and keep you focused on what's really important to you during the other timespans. Although your long-term concerns will surely ajust and evolve, the things you care about on this timescale are unlikely to completely change or go away entirely - or at least not very often.
- a few years: What you want to accomplish over the next few years
- the next year: What you want to accomplish in the next year
- the next month:
- today: What's important to you today, might not be important to you tomorrow. What can you do ever few hours to make the next few hours easier?
- the next hour:
- Now: What needs to be addressed right now?
### Channeling your creativity
Many productivity "experts" recommend that you get rid of this impulse, as they believe that curiousity leads to distractions. In my experience this is a bad idea. Beyond simply expanding your knowledgebase, curiosity can introduce you to new and better ways of accomplishing familiar problems, reveal entirely new opportunities that can lead you to fortune, serve as short-term motivation, or provide inspiration for solving problems you've all but given up on.

If necessity is the mother of invention, curiosity is the mother of innovation. Don't compromise on your curiousity, instead learn how to harness it.

Sometimes researching new and better ways of accomplishing something can contribute to procrastinating, either because it calls your current approach or decisions into question, or it opens new possibilities that you'd rather explore (which might also necessitate learning new tools or skills), or it's just a reason to be distracted. Looking for better ways of accomplishing goals is crucially important. It's how we get better, and faster.

Rather than curbing your curiousity completely, learn how to channel it. Learn how to say, "okay, I see there is a better way to do this thing I'm doing. I'll try that on the next project or when I have some free time to explore. But for now, I need to stay focused."
