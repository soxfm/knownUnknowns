# ZettelKasten Method

### Key Takeaways:
1. Improve interconnectivity of own thoughts and ideas: hypertextual nature of zettelkasten enables individuals to connect ideas; -- which in-turn, create the possibility for new insights to be generated. (Insights: are a result of making new connections; 'reaching point E from point A without previous perception of their possible co-relation.' )
2. increased Productivity: Streamlines workflow by giving clear guidelines on what to do. Increased possibility in entering 'FLOW' state.
3. Interconnected notes, regardless of their topic; could ultimately translate into possible future-useful resources for other projects.
4. Tackling Complexity: Zettelkasten allows people to concentrate on small tasks or sets of problems and after link them into the bigger picture.
5. Plain, normal note-taking is not a scalable form of personal growth/knowledge maintenance.
6. The Zettelkasten Method will make your writing easier, more coherent, smoother and more convincing. One of the main problems in writing and thinking is our limited capacity to follow one line of thought for a long period of time. Just think of meditation. It is even difficult to focus on a simple thing like breathing for a couple of minutes. Imagine how difficult it is to think about one issue for weeks and months to write a thesis. The Zettelkasten will hold your thoughts alive and help you to hold onto them

- "So in short, whenever you continue a train of thought, you  increment the last position in the address, be it a number or a character from the alphabet. And when you want to expand, intersperse, or comment on a note, you take its address and append a new character. For this to work, you alternate numbers and characters."
- ** HyperText ** : the non-linear link structure is the main trait of hypertext. In his manual on how to create a Zettelkasten, Luhmann wrote: "It is not important where you place a new note as long as you can link to it."
- The fixed address of each note is the alpha and omega of the world Zettelkasten. Everything becomes possible because of it.
- Replicating Luhmann's Zettelkasten, would require one to create a hypertext and limit its entry point via the most central pages on a topic, from which you would ocntinue by following links.

### Principles of Zettelkasten

1. Hyper-textual
2. Adheres to the __ Principle of Atomicity __
3. it is personal 

- **First**, it is some kind of hypertext, not a single text or just a collection of texts, but texts that refer to each other, explain, expand and use each other's information.
- Main difference between Zettelkasten's Method and 'regular note-taking' is is its __emphasis on forming relationships__. ** Zettelkasten makes connecting and not collecting a priority. ** 
- Text = linear, Hypertext = organic.
- **Second**, adhering to __Principle of Atomicity__: means that each note contains one unit of knowledge and only one. These units are the atoms to which the principle of atomicity refers to.
