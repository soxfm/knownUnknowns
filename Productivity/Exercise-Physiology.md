# Exercise Physiology 
----
The body's responses to a single bout of exercise are regulated by the principle of homeostasis. Homeostasis is defined as the ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment for cells by closely regulating various critical variables such as pH or acid base balance, oxygen tension, blood glucose concentration and body temperature.[9]

The overload, specificity, reversibility and individuality principles influence training adaptations in the body, for health as well as performance.

The application of an specific and appropriate stressor can sometimes be referred to as overloading the system. 
	- The overload principle states that habitually overloading a system causes it to respond and adapt. 
	- The overload principle can be quantified according to load (intensity and duration), repetition, rest and frequency. Load refers to the intensity of the exercise stressor i.e in strength training it can refer to the amount of resistance or in swimming it can refer to speed. The greater the load, the greater the fatigue and recovery time needed. 
	- Repetition implies the number of times that a load is applied. 
	- Rest refers to the time interval between repetitions and frequency refers to the number of training sessions per week

- The specificity principle states that only the system or body part repeatedly stressed will adapt to chronic overload. Therefore the overload principle will only apply to the system or body part used while exercising. 
- Reversibility states that whereas training may enhance performance, inactivity will lead to a decrease in performance.
- The individuality principle states that while the physiological responses to a particular stressor can be mostly predictable, the precise responses and adaptations will still differ among individuals. 
> "If muscles are under loaded, it does not matter how much they are exercised, they will increase little in strength. On the other side, if they are trained with at least 50 percent of maximal force of contraction, they will develop strength rapidly even if the contractions are performed only a few times each day. Using this principle, experiments on muscle building have shown that six nearly maximal muscle contractions performed in three sets 3 days a week give approximately optimal increase in muscle strength, without producing chronic muscle fatigue.
