# Perturbation Theory
### Overview
---

In mathematics and physics, perturbation theory comprises mathematical methods for finding an approximate solution to a problem, by starting from the exact solution of a related, simpler problem. A critical feature of the technique is a middle step that breaks the problem into "solvable" and "perturbative" parts. Perturbation theory is widely used when the problem at hand does not have a known exact solution, but can be expressed as a "small" change to a known solvable problem. Perturbation theory is used in a wide range of fields, and reaches its most sophisticated and advanced forms in quantum field theory. Perturbation theory for quantum mechanics imparts the first step on this path. The field in general remains actively and heavily researched across multiple disciplines.
