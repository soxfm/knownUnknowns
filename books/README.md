# Personal Book Reference List

divided into four different pages, the following books have been either:
  - read
  - unread (pertain to personal interest)
  - time-permits (stuff that should be read however is on hold due to bigger picture concerns)
  - shitlist (shit; purely was of time. don't bother)

### NOTE

  Also, there should be a reference within this system which regards books as real phyiscal materials
whilist also separating the e-book garbage(however interesting, the information gathered from kindle, kobo, libby,
apple books, audiobooks or general pdffiles; are really never truly absorbed [personal opinion]).
  Likewise, further down the road i'd like to partition the stuff i read from electronic prints into another list;
while also parsing the important information into 'md' documents.
