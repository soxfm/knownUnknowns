# Sport Sources
These are a some website which should be programmatically scrapped in order to create a 'Table-like'-database structure of both players and sports I play and/or
follow. The list is primarily compromised of either boxing or tennis.(Given that, I'm an not currently ranked as a pro boxer but am one and am on the verge of 
playing tennis at the ATP level.)
