# Theory of Constraints
## Overview
The theory of constraints (TOC) is a **management paradigm** that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. There is always at least on constraint, and TOC uses a focusing process to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it. TOC adopts the common idiom "a chain is no stronger than its weakest link". This means that processes, organizations, etc., are vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break them or at least adversely affect the outcome. 

### Key Assumption
the underlying premise of the theory of constraints is that organizations can be measured and controlled by variations on three measures: throughput, operational expnse, and inventory. Inventory is al the money that the system has invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell. Operational expense is all the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughput. Thoughput is the rate at which the system generates money through sales.

Before the goal itself can be reached, necessary conditions must first be met. These typically include safety, quality, legal obligations, etc.. For most businesses, the goal itself is to make profit. However, for many organizations and non-profit businesses, making money is a necessary condition for pursuing the goal. Whether it is the goal or necessary condition, understanding how to make sound financial decisions based on throughput, inventory, and operating expense is a critical requirement. 

#### The Five Focusing Steps

Theory of constraints is based on the premise that the rate of goal achievement by a goal-oriented system(ie. the system's throughput) is limited by at least one constraint. 

The argument by _reductio ad absurdum_ is as follows: if there was nothing preventing a system from achieving higher thoughput(ie. more goal units in a unit of time) its throughput would be infinite -- which is impossible in a real-life system.

Only by increasing flow through the constraint can overall throughput be increased. 

Assuming the goal of a system has been articulated and its measurements defined, the steps are:
  1. Identify the system's constraint(s).
  2. Decide how to exploit the system's constraint(s).
  3. Subordinate everything else to the above decision(s).
  4. Alleviate the system's constraint(s)
  5. Warning! if in the previous steps a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1, but do not allow inertia to cause a system's constraint.

### Constraints

A constraint is anything that prevents the system from achieving its goal. There are many ways that constraints can show up, but a core principle within TOC is that there are not tens or hundreds of constraints. There is at least one, but at most only a few in any given system. Constraints can be internal or external to the system. An internal constraint is in evidence when the market demands more from the system than it can deliver. If this is the case, then the focus of the organization should be on discovering that constraint and following the five focusing steps to open it up (and potentially remove it). An external constraint exists when the system can produce more than the market will bear. If this is the case, then the organization should focus on mechanisms to create more demand for its products or services. 

Type of (internal) constraints
- equipment: the way equipment is currently used limits the ability of the system to produce more salable goods/services
- People: lack of skilled people limits the system. **Mental Models** held by people can cause behaviour that becomes a constraint.
- Policy: A written or unwritten policy prevents the system from kaing more

_Note: "The concept of the constraint in Theory of Constraints is analogous to but differs from the constraint that shows up in mathematical optimization. In TOC, the constraint is used as a focusing mechanism for management of the system. In optimization, the constraint is written into the mathematical expressions to limit the scope of the solution (X can be no greater than 5). "_
