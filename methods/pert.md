# Program Evaluation and Review Technique or PERT

The **PERT** is a statistical tool used in project management, which was designed to analyze and represent the tasks involved in cpleting a given project.

### Overview

PERT is a method of analyzing the tasks involved in completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each tadsk, and to identify the minimum time needed to complete the total project. It incorporates uncertainty by making it possible to schedule a project while not knowing precisly the details and durations of all the activities. It is more fo an event-oriented technique rather than a start- and completion-oriented, and is used more in thos project where time is the major factor rather than cost. It is applied on very large-scale, one-time, complex, non-routine infrastructure and on Research and Development projects. 

**PERT** offers a management tool which relies "on arrow and node diagrams of activites and events: arrows represent the activities or work necessary to reach the vents or nodes that indicate each completed phase of the total project."

Both: **PERT** and **CPM** are complementary tools, because "CPM employs one time estimation and one cost estimation for each activity; PERT may utilize three time estimates (optimistic, expected, and pessimistic) and no costs for each activity. Although these are distinct differences, the term PERT is applied increasingle to all critical path scheduling."

### TIME

PERT has defined four types of time required to accomplish an activity:

    - optimistic time: the minimum possible time required to accomplish an activity (o) or a path (O), assuming everything proceeds better than is normally expected
    - pessimistic time: the maximum possible time required to accomplish an activity (p) or a path (P), assuming everything goes wrong (but excluding major catastrophes).
    - most likely time: the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (m) or a path (M), assuming everything proceeds as normal.
    - expected time: the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (te) or a path (TE), accounting for the fact that things don't always proceed as normal (the implication being that the expected time is the average time the task would require if the task were repeated on a number of occasions over an extended period of time).
    - standard deviation of time : the variability of the time for accomplishing an activity (σte) or a path (σTE)
