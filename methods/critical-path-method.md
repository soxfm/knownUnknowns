# Critical Path Method

  The **critical path method(CPM)** or critical path analysis, is an algorrithm for scheduling a set of project activities. It is commonly used in conjuction with the program evaluation and review technique **(PERT)**. A critical path is determined by identifying the longest stretch of dependent activities and measuring the time required to complete them from start to finish. 

### Basic Technique

### Components 

The essential technique for using CPM is to construct a model of the project that inclues the following:
  1. A list of all activities required to complete to the project(typically categorized within a work breakdown structure).
  2. the time(duration) that each activity will take to complete,
  3. The dependencies between the activies and,
  4. Logican end points such as milestones or deliverable items.

Using these values, CPM calculates the longest path of planned activities to logical end points or to the end of the project, and the earliest and latest that each activity can start and finish without making the project longer. 
This process determines which activities are "critical"(ie. on the longest path) and which have "total float"(ie. can be delayed without making the project longer). In project management, a critical path is the sequence of project network activities which add up to the longest overall duration, regardless if that longest duration has floar or not. This determines the shortest time possible to complete the project. 

CPM analysis tools allow a user to select a logical end point ina project and quickly identify its longest series of dependent activities(its longest path). These tools can display the critical path(and near critical path activities if desired) as a cascading waterfall that flows from the project's start(or current status date) to the selected logical end point.
