# Philosophical Razor

In philosophy, a razor is a principle or rule of thumb that allows one to eliminate ("shave off") unlikely explanations for a phenomenon, or avoid unnecessary actions.

Razors include: 
  - Occam's Razor: Simple explanations are more likely to be correct; avoid unnecessary or improbable assumptions.
  - Hanlon's Razor: Never attribute to malice that whcih can be adequately explained by stupidity
  - Hitchen's Razor: "What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence"
  - Hume's Guillotine: What ought to be cannot be deduced from what is. "If the cause, assigned for any effect, be not sufficient to product it, we must either reject that cause, or add to it such qualitites as will give it a just proportion to the effect."
  - Newton's flaming laser sword: if something cannot be settled by experiment or observation, then it is not worthy of debate.
  - Sagan Standard: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
  - Poppler's fasifiablity principle: For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be falsifiable.
  - Grice's Razor: as a principle of parsimony, conversational impliocations are to be preferred over semantic context for linguistic explanations.
