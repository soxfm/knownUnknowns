  - "The desire for excellence is an essential feature for doing great work. Without
	such a goalyou will ten to wander like a drunken sailor. The sailor takes one
	step in one direction and the next in some independent expected distance from the
	starting point is proportional to the square root of the number of steps taken.
	There is a tendency for the steps to go in the same direction and thus go a
	distance proportional to the number of steps taken.
	Which in a lifetime is alarge number indeed." (Richard Hamming)
