### Notes & General Overiew

- Assuming that mathematics is an integral part of Machine-Learning; strategically being able to query 'specifics' from datasetts or research-papers is only an effective techinque if you posses the required knowledege to comprehend the answers you find.
- Widening one's own perspective and expanding broad knowledge enables one to develop the necessary skillset required to judge, examine and, assess whichever information comes your way. Further refinement of this technique enables one to recognize references and separate 'more-technical' from 'less-technical' results. The third benefit, theoretically would be in farthering comprehension into becoming a possibility even despite one's own personal technical setbacks. Using results without actually needing to deepen one's own understanding of the details. 
- In supervised learning, you have a bunch of data, a specific question you want to answer, and access to the correct answer to many instances of that question. In unsupervised learning, you have a bunch of data points, and you want to find meaningful patterns in the structure of that data. In reinforcement learning, you have a task you want to take actions to accomplish, and you don't have any access to knowing what the best action is, but after each action you get a rough idea of how good the result was.
- Artificial Intelligence models do not need to follow the same pattern of human though.
- **Almost all of machine learning is representing data as vectors and perfming linear and non-linear transformations in order to perform**classification, regressions, tokenization or whichever model is being used.
- Most of ML is fitting models to data. To fit a model you minimize some error measure as a function of its real valued parameters, e.g. the weights of the connections in a neural network. 
- **The algorithms to do the minimization are based on gradient descent, which depends on derivatives, i.e. differential calculus.**
