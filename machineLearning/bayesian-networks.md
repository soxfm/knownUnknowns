# Summary
Bayesian networks are a graphical formalism for representing the structure of a probabilistic model, i.e. the ways in which the random variables may depend on each other. Intuitively, they are good at representing domains with a causal structure, and the edges in the graph determine which variables directly influence which other variables. They can be equivalently viewed as representing a factorization structure of the joint probability distribution, or as encoding a set of conditional independence assumptions about the distribution.

## Context

This concept has the prerequisites:

    random variables (Bayes nets are a way of structuring information about random variables.)
    conditional independence (Bayes nets can be viewed as encoding a set of conditional independence assumptions.)
    Bayes' rule (Bayes nets are used for forms of reasoning based on Bayes' Rule.)
