## "Big" Data?

If you are working with data-intensive applications at all, I'll recommend this book:

* **[_Designing Data-Intensive Applications_](http://dataintensive.net)** by Martin Kleppman. (You can start reading it online, free, via Safari Books.) It's not specific to Machine Learning, but you can bridge that gap yourself.

Lastly, here are some other useful links regarding Big Data and ML.

* [10 things statistics taught us about big data analysis](https://simplystatistics.org/2014/05/22/10-things-statistics-taught-us-about-big-data-analysis/) (and some more food for thought: ["What Statisticians think about Data Scientists"](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/what-statisticians-think-about-data-scientists))
* ["Talking Machines" #12](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/2015/6/4/the-economic-impact-of-machine-learning-and-using-the-kernel-trick-to-dig-in-to-big-data): Interviews Prof. Andrew Ng (from [our main course, which has its own module on big data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)); this episode covers some problems relevant to _high-dimensional_ data
- ["Talking Machines" #15: "Really Really Big Data and Machine Learning in Business"](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/2015/7/16/really-really-big-data-and-machine-learning-in-business)
- Free eBook, [_Getting Data Right: Tackling the Challenges of
Big Data Volume and Variety_](https://www.tamr.com/landing-pages/getting-data-right/) by Michael Stonebraker, Tom Davenport, James Markarian, and others, published by O'Reilly. You can [listen to an accompanying podcast](http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/06/the-future-of-data-at-scale.html) too.

## Finding Open-Source Libraries

* Bookmark **[awesome-machine-learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning)**, a curated list of [awesome](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) Machine Learning libraries and software.
* Bookmark [Pythonidae](https://github.com/svaksha/pythonidae/blob/master/AI.md#machine-learning), a curated list of [awesome](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) libraries and software in the Python language - with a section on Machine Learning.
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) has been a [really big deal.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10532957) People like you will do exciting things with TensorFlow. It's a framework. Frameworks can help you manage complexity. Just remember this rule of thumb: **"More data beats a cleverer algorithm"** (Domingos), no matter how cool your tools are. Also note, TensorFlow is not the only machine learning framework of its kind: **[Check this great, detailed comparison of TensorFlow, Torch, and Theano.](https://github.com/zer0n/deepframeworks)** See also [Newmu/Theano-Tutorials](https://github.com/Newmu/Theano-Tutorials) and  [nlintz/TensorFlow-Tutorials](https://github.com/nlintz/TensorFlow-Tutorials). See also the section on Deep Learning above.
    * Also, consider [Lore](https://github.com/instacart/lore/). "Lore is a python framework to make machine learning [especially deep learning] approachable for Engineers and maintainable for Data Scientists." 
* For Machine-Learning libraries that might not be on PyPI, GitHub, etc., there's [MLOSS (Machine Learning Open Source Software)](http://mloss.org/software/). Seems to feature many academic libraries.
* Bookmark [Julia.jl](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/AI.md#machine-learning), a curated list of [awesome](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) libraries and software in the Julia language - with a section on Machine Learning.
