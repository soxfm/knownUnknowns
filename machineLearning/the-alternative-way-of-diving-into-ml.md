## Alternative ways to "Dive into Machine Learning"

Here are some other guides to Machine Learning. They can be alternatives or complements to this guide.

* ["How would your curriculum for a machine learning beginner look like?"](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/ml-curriculum.html) by Sebastian Raschka. A selection of the core online courses and books for getting started with machine learning and gaining expert knowledge. It contextualizes Raschka's own book, [_Python Machine Learning_](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book) (which I would have linked to anyway!) See also [`pattern_classification` GitHub repository](https://github.com/rasbt/pattern_classification) maintained by the author, which contains IPython notebooks about various machine learning algorithms and various data science related resources.
* [Materials for Learning Machine Learning](http://jacksimpson.co/materials-for-learning-machine-learning/) by Jack Simpson
* Courses by cloud vendors (may be specific to their tools/platforms)
    * [Machine Learning Crash Course from Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) with TensorFlow APIs. This is Google's fast-paced, practical introduction to machine learning which features a series of lessons with video lectures, real-world case studies, and hands-on practice exercises.
    *  [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learning-paths/machine-learning/) Amazon have open up their internal training to the public and also offer certification. 30 courses - 45+ hours of content.
* [Machine Learning for Developers](http://xyclade.github.io/MachineLearning/) is another good introduction, perhaps better if you're more familiar with Java or Scala. It introduces machine learning for a developer audience using Smile, a machine learning library that can be used both in Java and Scala.
* [Example Machine Learning notebook, exercise, and guide](https://github.com/rhiever/Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/example-data-science-notebook/Example%20Machine%20Learning%20Notebook.ipynb) by Dr. Randal S. Olson. Mentioned in Notebooks section as well, but it has a similar goal to this guide (introduce you, and show you where to go next). Rich "Further Reading" section.
* [Machine Learning for Software Engineers](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers) by Nam Vu. Itâ€™s the top-down and results-first approach designed for software engineers.
* For some news sources to follow, check out [Sam DeBrule's list](https://machinelearnings.co/a-humans-guide-to-machine-learning-e179f43b67a0) here.
* [Distill](https://distill.pub/about/) is a journal devoted to clear and interactive explanations of the lastest research in machine learning. They offer an alternative to traditional academic publishing that promotes accessibility and transparency in the field.
