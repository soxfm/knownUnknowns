# Observable Physics Phenomena
### Generalized list
#### Unordered

These are General Concepts with links to their relevant wikipedia page and their first paragraph descriptions 

- (Abstraction)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction]Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal ("real" or "concrete") signifiers, first principles, or other methods. 
- Abstraction in CS (subwiki topic): Abstraction allows program designers to separate a framework (categorical concepts related to computing problems) from specific instances which implement details. This means that the program code can be written so that code doesn't have to depend on the specific details of supporting applications, operating system software, or hardware, but on a categorical concept of the solution
- (Information)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information] : Information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty; it is that which answers the question of "What an entity is" and thus defines both its essence and nature of its characteristics. The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts. Thus the concept becomes related to notions of constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, representation, and entropy.
- (Taxonomy)[https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(general)]
- (Philosophy of Information) [https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_information] : Philosophy of information is a branch of philosophy that studies topics relevant to computer science, information science and information technology. _note to self: **Book** Decoding Reality, by Vlato Vedral_
- (Magnus Effect)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect] : is an observable
phenomenon that is commonly associated with a spinning object moving through air or
another fluid. The path of the spinning object is deflected in a manner that is not
present when the object is not spinning. The deflection can be explained by the
difference in pressure of the fluid on opposite sides of the spinning object.
The Magnus Effect depends on the speed of rotation. eg. TopSpin
- (Shannon's Law)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem] : In information theory, the Shannon-Hartley theorem tells the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a commubnciations channel of a specified bandwith in the presence of noise. It is an application of the noisy-channel coding theorem to the archetypal case of a continous-time analog communications channel subject to Gaussian noise. The theorem establishes Shannon's channel capacity for such a communication link, a bound on the maximum amount of error-free information per time unit that can be transmitted with a specified bandwidth in the presence of the noise interference,
assuming that the signal power is bounded, and that the Gaussian noise process
is characterized by a known power or power spectral density.
- (Metadata)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata]: Metadata is "data that provides information about other data". In other words, it is "data about data". Many distinct types of metadata exist, including descriptive metadata, structural metadata, administrative metadata, reference metadata and statistical metadata.
