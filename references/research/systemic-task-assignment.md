# Method

  This method has been outlined within a (reddit post)[https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/73n9pm/d_confession_as_an_ai_researcher_seeking_advice/dnrsmh9/]
  and has been rewritten to fit my own personal purposes.

### Systemic Task Assignment

#### ** "To walk the borderd of the Unknown" **:
  
  - Begin by defining the current knowledge phase:
    ie.
  what/which knowledge you posses in regards to the subject in question,
  the tools at your disposal and, any other relevant information you already
  posses. > Refine this process by etching out list and tagging/ticking areas of
  both interest and comfort. \(such as to refine and order them in terms of weight
  based system/Outline.\)
  - **Clearly** state your goals: "Define what you have to understand in order to
   reach, complete, achieve, transform or build upon the chosen subject; how,
   can you add value, scale, recreate or innovate upon in a way that aggregates or
   simplifies to a better end-\(result,product,service\)"
  - **Your Job Now is finding :**
   __"shortest path for the accomplishment of your task".__
   __Meaning using the a high abstraction, what is needed to solve your question.__
  - "In most cases you cant find a simple path just on the first try. If so you are, as we say, "drilling a thin board". I mostly start with the "solution side", so what is the step to be taken before you reach your goal (also try to 
   define it abstract). And than the next and so on.Try to put a "node" to each side 
   (start point and goal) till you let them meet.
   **This is now your shortest path.**"
  - Now, look at your steps and compile a traceback list of dependencies: missing/
   lacking knowledge and stuff you need to work out. What should be learned, which
   information should be considered relevant and what is merely noise.
   These are your milestones: **definining what should be learned, experimented and analyzed**.
  - "Now in the process you will find new questions, new thinks you need to know. This will "thicken" your path. There are 2 kinds, the "must have" and the "nice to have", say good bye to the nice to have or do it in your free time as hobby. Sleep and reevaluate your "must haves" 90% of the time its a "nice to have""
   - __**If you use "second hand" thinking as a substituent to your own, you might never move beyond the boarder in the unknown**__
