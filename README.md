"All generalizations  are false"
'Subjet: **What your Known**' : "As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don’t know we don’t know." and you can only know more about those things imagining what they might be." - Donald J Rumsfeld
