#### A Tribute to the World's Greatest Politician.

**"All generalizations  are false"**
__"Including this one "__

'Subject: **What your Known**' : "As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don’t know we don’t know." and you can only know more about those things imagining what they might be." - Donald Rumsfeld

	# ** THE RULES **
----
	### Basic Principles
	Core Foundation for achieving, over-achieving, succeeding, attaining greatness; -- enforcement of these rules throughout life is paramount for both learning and life achievements.
		
	- "Always Protect your Investment."
	- "In every Game or Con there is always a Victim and an Opponent; the trick is to know when you're the latter so that you can become, the former."
----	
	### RULES
		1. "The Only way to Get Smarter is by Playing a Smarter Opponnent" (Fundamentals of Chess, 1822)
		2. "The more sophisticated the game, the more sophisticated the opponent."
		3. "If the opponent is very Good; he'll place his victims within an environment he can control. The bigger the environment, the greater the Control."
		4. "Whenever the opponent exercises a trick in order to control his victims; two basic principles come into question:" 
			1. The older the trick and the more apparently obvious/distinctly discernible the trick is; the easier it is to pull of.
			2. This is Based upon the idea that "it is very difficult for even the smartest of victims to accept within himself that his intelligence is being put front; into question." (It is just like questioning the victim's intelligence or investment; 'he' cannot accept the idea that someone would be pulling such an "obvious con" upon him; -- the victim refuses to accept that 'he' could be conned in such an obvious and evident manner.) And thus, his mind automatically disregards the obvious in order to 'protect' the victim's ego.
		5. "You'll always find a good opponent in the very last place you'll every look" (Chinese Proverb)

##### Further Notes
 "The trick is for me to feed pieces to you and make you believe that you took those piece because 'You're smarter'; and 'I'm Dumber'. "; -- Gradually ; the victim will become consumed with his own consumption. 
	"Toss the dog a bone.."
	"Give'm just a bit of what he thinks he wants"
