# The Meaning of a 'HACK'
---
> “The word hack doesn't really have 69 different meanings”, according to MIT hacker Phil Agre. “In fact, hack has only one meaning, an extremely subtle and profound one which defies articulation. Which connotation is implied by a given use of the word depends in similarly profound ways on the context. Similar remarks apply to a couple of other hacker words, most notably random.”
> Hacking might be characterized as ‘an appropriate application of ingenuity’. Whether the result is a quick-and-dirty patchwork job or a carefully crafted work of art, you have to admire the cleverness that went into it.

### BASIS
> "For those who stubbornly seek freedom, there can be no more urgent task than to come to understand the mechanisms and practices of indoctrination. These are easy to perceive in the totalitarian socities, much less so in the systems of 'brainwashing under freedom' to which we are subjected and which all to often we serve as willing or unwitting instruments"
  - 'Noam Chomksy'

##### Rumself's Rules
**"All generalizations  are false"**
__"Including this one "__

'Subject': **What your Known**' : "As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don’t know we don’t know." and you can only know more about those things imagining what they might be." 
- US. Secretary of State : Donald Rumsfeld

__Original Full Text__
"Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones"
> Known unknowns refers to "risks you are aware of, such as canceled flights; weather fluctuation which could pose a risky outcomes or other generalized daily uncontrollables. 
> **Unknown Unknowns** are risks that come from situations whose improbability is so great that; -- their mere existence or possibility of occurence may be able to skip your imagination. These, are the either: revolutionary ideas which might've changed/impacted the world and its progression (eg.personal computer) or, __"given that there has been no prior experience which resembles the phenomenom in question; -- have no prior theoretical basis within existence.__

Expanding upon Rummy's princinples.

> Psychoanalytic philosopher Slavoj Žižek says that beyond these three categories there is a fourth, the unknown known, that which we intentionally refuse to acknowledge that we know: "If Rumsfeld thinks that the main dangers in the confrontation with Iraq were the 'unknown unknowns', that is, the threats from Saddam whose nature we cannot even suspect, then the Abu Ghraib scandal shows that the main dangers lie in the "unknown knowns"—the disavowed beliefs, suppositions and obscene practices we pretend not to know about, even though they form the background of our public values"

NOTE: The Underlying Principles, were put together and conveyed by 'GR'; the overall idea here is that "ego" is the enemy. However, as provided by modern cognitive psychology and also emphasized throughout the life of Friedriche Nietszche ( read: "Beyond Good and Evil" ); -- the 'Ego' itself is not your enemy. It's existence is part of you and most human attempts concerned with either ignoring or separting yourself from your own ego results in major mental ilness( ie. schizophrenia ). The idea here is not to bypass or fight your ego but to acknowledge what it is trying to tell you. Most times, it is merely a manifestation of certain insecurities, concerns or, reminders which point to something meaningful.

** Regardless of whatever basic principle you come to find interesting; one should always rule above all else: "Harmony within reflects harmony throughin and throughout. Strive for harmony and compassion within while living above your own demons. "

### ** Basic Principles **
---

  - "Never underestimate anyone whom you come in contact with."
  - "Don't make the classic smart person's mistake: 'Thinking that you're smarter than everyone else."
  - "Hope, despite being warm and fuzzy; -- is **not** a plan."
  -  		
	- "Always Protect your Investment."
	- "In every Game or Con there is always a Victim and an Opponent; the trick is to know when you're the latter so that you can become, the former."
----	
	### RULES
		1. "The Only way to Get Smarter is by Playing a Smarter Opponnent" (Fundamentals of Chess, 1822)
		2. "The more sophisticated the game, the more sophisticated the opponent."
		3. "If the opponent is very Good; he'll place his victims within an environment he can control. The bigger the environment, the greater the Control."
		4. "Whenever the opponent exercises a trick in order to control his victims; two basic principles come into question:" 
			1. The older the trick and the more apparently obvious/distinctly discernible the trick is; the easier it is to pull of.
			2. This is Based upon the idea that "it is very difficult for even the smartest of victims to accept within himself that his intelligence is being put front; into question." (It is just like questioning the victim's intelligence or investment; 'he' cannot accept the idea that someone would be pulling such an "obvious con" upon him; -- the victim refuses to accept that 'he' could be conned in such an obvious and evident manner.) And thus, his mind automatically disregards the obvious in order to 'protect' the victim's ego.
		5. "You'll always find a good opponent in the very last place you'll every look" (Chinese Proverb)

##### Further Notes
 "The trick is for me to feed pieces to you and make you believe that you took those piece because 'You're smarter'; and 'I'm Dumber'. "; -- Gradually ; the victim will become consumed with his own consumption. 
	"Toss the dog a bone.."
	"Give'm just a bit of what he thinks he wants"
