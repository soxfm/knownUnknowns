# Web scraping definition

web scraping (also called internet scraping, website scraping) is an automated process
of gathering publicly available data form targeted websites. Instead of collecting data
manually, web scraping tools acquire a vast amount of intel within seconds.

## web scraping process

basic definition of the process:

	1. Making requests for targeted websites: web scraping tools are making HTTP
		requests, such as GET and POST to the target websites for the contents
		of a specific url.
	2. Extracting required data. Requested web servers return the data in the HTML
		format. However, you might need to extract specific information from the HTML
		file. In this case, web scrapers parse the data according to requirements.
	3. Storing scraped data. The data needs to be stored in CSV,JSON formats, or in any
		database for further usage.

### Crawling vs Scraping

	- Web scraping is when you take any online publicly available data and import the
	found information into any local file on your computer. The main difference here to
	data scraping is that web scraping requires the internet to be conducted.
  - Web crawling (or data crawling) is used for data extraction and refers to collecting data from either the world wide web, or in data crawling cases â€“ any document, file, etc. Traditionally, it is done in large quantities, but not limited to small workloads. Therefore, usually done with a crawler agent. 
  - " A crawler is a program that connects web pages and downloads their contents."
